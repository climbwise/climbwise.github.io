# Barometer - Privacy Policy

Effective Date: November 6, 2024

At Climbwise, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the
personal information you share with us.

## Data Collection

Our app does not collect, store, or share any personal information. The only
data we access is the barometer sensor data provided by your device. This data
is used solely to provide you with accurate barometric pressure readings. We do
not collect any identifiable data, location information, or other personal data.

## Data Security

Since no personal data is collected, there is minimal risk regarding the
security of your data. Any data captured from the barometer sensor remains on
your device and is not transmitted to us or any third parties.

## Third-Party Services

Our app does not integrate with third-party services, and therefore, no
third-party services are involved in processing or storing data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our
app or legal requirements. When we update the policy, we will notify you by
updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this document.
